          <p class="quote">"Tori is all you could want from a PT and so much more. From our very first session she made me feel comfortable and at ease. The sessions are well-planned, varied and pacey. Tori soon noticed both my strengths and weaknesses and celebrates what I can do well and encourages those movements that are still developing. Tori is so motivational and inspiring. She has great anatomical knowledge and ensures I am keeping good form at all times. I look forward to our sessions so much and can‚Äôt wait to see where she takes my fitness journey. Tori makes me want to be better, fitter and stronger. If you‚Äôve ever thought about having PT sessions, now is the time to do it."

She‚Äôs helped me become more confident and comfortable with myself and my body! She‚Äôs taught me many recipes as well as killer workouts that leave me aching for days! My mindset has changed drastically and I now have more good days than bad! So I thankyou for that and here‚Äôs to another 4 months of improvement and hard work üëåüèºüí´"

          <p class="quote">"Tory is the best person to go to if you need a personal trainer. In my case, I was scared to go to the gym and I always wanted to get fitter but I didn‚Äôt know exactly how to do it. She got me a coffee and asked me what I wanted to achieve, so she then made me a very specific plan that followed my lifestyle and my goals and encouraged me to make going to the gym something fun. As a performer I 100% recommend her because she knows dancer‚Äôs bodies very closely being one herself. She is always looking for new techniques and new ways to help her clients and her positivity is just AMAZING! She is a superwoman!"

          <p class="quote">"After having my little girl in June 2019 and booking our wedding for October 2019 I decided I was going to need a personal trainer, at least for a few sessions, to help build my confidence in the gym and motivate me to get back into working out.
            I always attended the gym on my own pre baby, never fully knowing what I was doing or having any sort of plan. I would do 10 mins of cardio followed by 50 mins of strengthening and toning. My sessions were boring and monotonous. So when a friend recommend Tory I jumped at the chance to meet her.
            We met for coffee about 5 weeks after having baby and she instantly made me feel comfortable. It was like I was meeting an old friend. Tory asked about my previous experience, goals and aspirations and we spoke about availability etc. I knew I wanted to work with her instantly!
            I wanted to get stuck in straight away, but instead of taking my money and potentially causing me injury Tory insisted we wait until I was 8 weeks postpartum which I really respected.
            I was a bit nervous at the beginning of my first session but Tory made me feel so at ease. All in all I had 4 sessions with Tory and I learned so much during that time! I now feel that I could walk into any gym and own it which I would never have done before. I‚Äôve even been in the weight section by myself which I was always really nervous about doing on my own!
            I can hand on heart say that Tory is one of the kindest most genuine people I have ever met Couple that with being a fantastic personal trainer and it‚Äôs needless to say that I hold her with high regard.
            I can‚Äôt wait to start up my sessions with Tory again when I go back to work after maternity leave and I may also try her monthly online coaching.
            Thank you again for everything!

          <p class="quote">"I‚Äôve wanted to start training with a PT for a while now but hadn‚Äôt found anyone that inspired me, that was until attempting one insta class during lockdown with Tori & I knew I‚Äôd found my trainer. Her knowledge & attention to detail on form, alongside her ability to push me to my limit in a fun constructive way keep me going back every week (even after needing a half hour lay down to recover from last weeks session) She is also now helping me with nutrition which is a side to PT that I never fully appreciated, I am excited to get fit with her as my mentor"

          <p class="quote">"It‚Äôs my 4th PT session since I have finished my online coaching with Tori.
            She is professional and friendly, not only she tailored the workout to my ability but she pushes me to the next level, to become stronger, fitter, not only in body üí™üèªbut my mind too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
            I feel a lot more confident, her encouragement during and outside of the sessions is just simply amazing. 
            This little ray of sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è has such a positive impact on my wellbeing, she is not just your average PT, she is ‚ÄúTHE PT‚Äù if you want to want to see a positive change.
            Thanks for everything you have done so far Tori, can‚Äôt wait to see how much stronger my body can be üíïüíï
