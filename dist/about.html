        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="message">
          <p>Let me introduce myself, I’m Tori! I’m a personal trainer, online coach and pre and post natal fitness specialist based in Sidcup, London. Health and fitness has always been something I’m extremely passionate about, so being able to turn my passion into a career is such a dream.
            <br>
            <br>
            I grew up in Devon with a passion for performing arts and then moved to London when I was 18 to attend performing arts school. Being a dancer, it was crucial that I understood the importance of staying healthy and strong to support my physically demanding lifestyle; that was where my passion for fitness was born.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Whilst performing in the West End, I studied alongside performing to become a personal trainer; this was the best decision I’ve ever made. I started working at F45 Tottenham Court road and then later moved to a gym local to where I am currently living in Sidcup.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I offer a variety of different services as I am aware that one size doesn’t fit all. I offer 1-1 personal training sessions in Sidcup, 1-1 personal training sessions via Zoom and also online coaching. Have a look at the different packages I offer to find out more about these options. 
            <br>
            <br>
            
            If you’re looking to transform your mind-set and create a sustainable lifestyle that’s totally individual to you, then I’m here to help you achieve that. I pride myself on creating plans that are maintainable, enjoyable and educational. Why wait? Drop me an email now to get started with your journey to feeling amazing.
